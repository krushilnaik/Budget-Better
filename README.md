When a user visits the website they are greeted to a sign in page. Once the user is signed in, they are taken to a dashboard of each event that is stored in the database for that user.
When the user creates a new event, they add a title/name of the event. Then, they can start to add line items of various things that are needed for such event. For example, if a user creates an event for a wedding,
they can create line items for:
flowers, limo, and catering. They will then enter the cost of each item in the front end, and we will take that entered information and send it in a post request to the database.
